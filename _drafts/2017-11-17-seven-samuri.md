title: Seven Systems Samurai
---
TLDR:

The context for an intervention complex. It includes the often toxic legacy of all the previous solutions, the social context, marketing and potential misinformation and vested interested.

Few people enjoy having their vested interested exposed.

This is very SSM. Understanding where you are starting, how you got here, why thing look as they do is interesting. Whatever you do will also have competitors (patterns of strategy) and will cause issues that you, or someone will need to solve, in an unknowable future.





Tim James blogged about the Seven Samurai of systmes thinking [described](http://systemsthinkersanonymous.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/US-Government-Non-Defense-The-Seven-Samurai-of-Systems-Engineering-Dealing-with-the-Complexity-of-7-Interrelated-Systems-James-Martin.pdf) here.



Overall Context

Context System Elements

Pre-Existing “Solutions”
Physical Environment (air, land, sea)
Regulatory Environment (laws, regulations, customs, ethics, stigmas)
Information (data, signals, noise)
Knowledge (information, knowledge, wisdom, “best” practices)
But there is also

Anti-Knowledge (misinformation, lies, stupidity)
Emotions (love, hate, delight, disappointment)
Aesthetics (elegance, beauty, cultural expectations)
*Is this all marketing?*
Beginning with a problem

Understand context

Design a solution, in a design context

Implementation may not be the same as designed, in impementation context

And may cause issues, not unlike the first issues we had, either expected, or due to design

There may also be competing solutions (with their own issues)

But we don't begin with a problem, we begin with a situation that has a solution applied, there were alternative solutions, and each has different problems.

We may have even solved a few problems we didn't know we had - or created new areas of business
