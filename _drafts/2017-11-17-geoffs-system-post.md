System Holism Principle: A system has holistic properties possessed by none of its parts. Each of the system parts has properties not possessed by the system as a whole. 2. Darkness Principle: no system can be known completely. 3. Eighty-Twenty Principle: In any large, complex system, eighty per cent of the output will be produced by only twenty per cent of the system. 4. Complementarity Law: Any two different perspectives (or models) about a system will reveal truths about that system that are neither entirely independent nor entirely compatible. Hierarchy Principle: Complex natural phenomena are organized in hierarchies with each level made up of several integral systems. 6. Godel’s Incompleteness Theorem: All consistent axiomatic foundations of number theory include un decidable propositions. 7. Entropy – the Second Law of Thermodynamics: In any closed system the differences in energy can only stay the same or decrease over time; or, in any closed system the amount of order (or organization) can never increase and must eventually decrease Redundancy of Information Theorem: Errors in information transmission can be protected against (to any level of confidence required) by increasing the redundancy in the messages. 9. Redundancy of Resources Principle: Maintenance of stability under conditions of disturbance requires redundancy of critical resources. 10. Redundancy of Potential Command Principle: In any complex decision network, the potential to act effectively is conferred by an adequate concatenation of information. 11. Relaxation time Principle: System stability is possible only if the system’s relaxation time is shorter than the mean time between disturbances. 12. Circular Causality Principle One: Given positive feedback (i.e., a two-part system in which each stimulates any initial change in the other), radically different end states are possible from the same initial conditions. Circular Causality Principle Two: Given negative feedback (i.e., a two-part system in which each part tends to offset any change in the other), the equiibrial state is invariant over a wide range of initial conditions. Feedback dominance theorem: For high gain amplifiers, the feedback dominates the output over wide variations in input. Homeostasis Principle: A system survives only so long as all essential variables are maintained within their physiological limits.

The first construct of systems thinkng is that Systems Do Not Exist

A system consists of all the interactive sets of variables that could be controlled by participating actors. Meanwhile, the environment consists of all those variables that, although affecting the system's behaviour, could not be controlled by it. The system boundary becomes an arbitrary, subjective construct defined by the interest and the level of the ability and/or authority of the participating actors. From this perspective systems don’t exist other than as a personal construct and worldview.

Computing; designing and building software. ST has absolutely NOTHING to do with COMPUTERS or COMPUTING
