title: Unit 500 Understanding the Skills, Principals and Practice of Effective Management Coaching and Mentoring

# Question 1
## Define what coaching and mentoring is within the context of an organisation. Explain the similarities and differences

*Coaching* is a non directive guided exploration of issues, situations or skills.

*Mentoring* is more directive guidance or instruction perhaps for a particular process or goal the mentor has achieved.

Coaching is
* Client led
* Coach is not domain expert
* Often paid for

Mentoring is
* Mentor led
* Mentor is a domain expert
* Often not paid for, although Business Consultants could be seen as paid for mentors, providing domain expertese and advice for organisations

Both are concerned with positive change
Both should benefit the organization and the individual
Mentoring may not be a transferable skill. It may be domain specific

Coaching deals with what is inside a person, and maps their internal landscape. Mentoring deals with things outside a person and maps an environment, including a journey that the mentee may wish to follow.

## Identify potential individual, operational and organisational barriers to using coaching or mentoring, and develop appropriate strategies for minimising or overcoming these.
* Barrier to Mentoring - Finding suitable mentors and mentees
* Demonstrating return on investment for coaching or mentoring
* Finding time operationally for coaching or mentoring
* Organisational culture may not be suitable for mentoring
* Organisational culture may not value coaching. It could be seen as a 'soft' nice to have


# Question 2

# Question 3
## Part 1
## Review a model or process which should be followed when formally coaching or Mentoring

### 1 Scoping
Asking do I want this work?
* Need to ask of the requestor or sponsor
 * What is happening right now? (Patterns)
 * What would you like to have happen?
 * What needs to happen so what you would like to have happen is automatic?

 The answers will inform if the coaching work is likely to be successful, or if another coach of style of coaching can be recommended.
(from metaphorum2 video)

### 2 Contracting
Agree the scope and context of the work, including
* Boundaries
* Smart goals
* Recipients (Ideally not 'do X to Y' avoided during #1 Scoping)

### 3 Pre session
* Ring or email everyone with clean setup
* For group coaching, ask what can be shared

### 4 Plan Sessions
Sessions need
* Suitable location or
* Suitable shared software for online, such as Skype, Zoom, or appear.in

### 5 Contracting


### 6 Where, Why, How, When, Who
Ensure there are answers to the above questions

### 7 feedback
After the coaching feedback on the coaching and it's effictiveness should be sought, either in person or via feedback forms.

## Question 3
## Part 2
### Analyse the the rational for and the characteristics of effective contracting
The Rational
* So both sides of the agreement know what to expect
* To define goals that are smart. (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timebound)
* Reduction of Risk
* To protect the Coach and Clients
* Set expectations
* To frame what Coaching or Mentoring is, and is not
 * for example coaching is not psychotherapy

Contracts will contain Coaching Plans with
* Timescales
* Exercises
* Number of Sessions

The contract will explain the necessity of exploring the expectations and boundaries of a coaching or mentoring programme with all stakeholders

We need to ensure that all stakeholders have the correct model of understanding of what is involved. Exploring expectations and boundaries is necessary as clients may have lower or higher expectations of coaching than can be provided with the agreed time and resources.

It will be necessary to agree the boundaries between work and non work content, so that the focus of the session is correct.

The boundary between what is, and what is not coaching needs to be agreed so that the coach and client know when to involve other specialists.

The boundaries around a 'sucessful outcome' should be understood. The coach is not responsible for the outcome, only for providing the environment for a successful outcome to occur.

If those getting the coaching are different from those paying for it there needs to be a shared understanding of the expectations of Coach, Coachee and Fundholder.

Shared expectations allow the coach to specify what is expected of the coachee, in terms of preparation, disclosure of 'stuff', answering the question "Is there anything I need to know", and any behavioral expectations that may be required. Coaches need to work with people that want to be coached.

- Justify the rational for supervision of coaches and mentors in practise.
