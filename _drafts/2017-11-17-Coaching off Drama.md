## Karpman Drama Triangle
We've seen the Drama Triangle Before. There is Persecutor Rescuer and Victim, and when in Drama we start at one of these positions.

We usually start when we age not getting what we want, and our starting position may be coupled with someone else's drama behaviour (and the coupled reaction of Barry Oshrys Seeing Systems is useful here), or we may get on the drama triangle ourselves, at our starting gate position.

Once in drama we can quickly go through the 3 states, or oscilate between two. Note that the other parties are likely to be moving around the triangle too. The positions taken up may be influenced by Oshrys Seeing Systems and heirarchy too.

## Notice your own drama
It's useful to notice when you are on the drama triangle in different relationships in your life.

 ### Exercises
 #### What you say as Persecutor

 #### What you say as Rescuer

 #### What you say as Victim

# Notice invites onto drama from others

### When invited to Persecutor
* But they are idiots, right?
* Why did they do that? (with no curiosity)

### When invited to Rescue
* Opps.
* Arrgh.
* I can't cope.

### When invited to Victim
* We'll there is nothing you can do, is there?
* I'd just give up.
* It's pointless for you to do that.

## What to Say when declining a drama invite
In declining an invite to drama there are at least two things occurring
* Firstly you decline to see the situation from the positions
on the drama triangle.
* You need to react to the response of the person behind the invite
** They may be on the triangle themselves
** or they may be knowingly getting you to react in a particular way

Either way requires a suitable response.

# Coaching yourself off drama

# Coaching someone else off drama

# The tools we need
### 1. Knowledge of the Drama Triange and our own starting gate positions

### Exercises
What are our patterns? What patterns do others notice?

## 2. Clean Feedback.
### Evidence, Inference, Impact

### over 3 situations WWW, WWnsW, WCYDDnt
We can ask these questions from each position on the drama triangle.

### Exercises
Give clean feedback to others about what they have said and done.
Use Evidence, Inference and Impact.

### 3. Clean Setup
When <situation> goes as you'd like, it would be like what?
When <situation> goes as you'd like, you would be like what?
What resources do you need?

## Alternative inquiry position for the Drama Triangle
Using the Clean Feedback questions we can find out more about each position
Persecutor to Validator
What exactly did we see and hear?
What feedback can we give?
Then Clean Setup, and Development Task.

Rescuer to Mediator
What have we actually been asked to do?
Then Clean Setup and Development Task.

Victim to ??
What do we want to have happen?
Then Clean Setup and Development task.
