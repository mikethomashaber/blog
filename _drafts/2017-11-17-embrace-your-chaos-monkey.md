title: Embrace your Chaos Monkey

Chaos Monkey and Systems Dynamics. Each bit needs it's own monkey.
The offsping of the chaos monkey is the Blackish Swan.





Humans love a good system. There seems to be a particular human behaviour of wanting to project plans and systems onto the future. It's a form of control that seems to itch a need that is in most of us. We love knowing what to expect, and we love it when a plan comes together. We think that plan will come together, no matter how many times in the past things haven't quite worked out.

Most systems in real life are a bit messy. They just evolve from things bumping along together. It's really hard to design ones that look like they might work from scratch though.

Look at this optical illusion. Get a straight edge and prove the lines are actually straight.

Look away for a few seconds, and look back. You're not the sort of person who gets fooled by the same trick twice, right? And what does this have to do with making plans :-)

No matter how much our projects have not gone to plan, is it like the illusion? Every time we think we won't get fooled (just plan harder!),  we still come unstuck more often than not.

There are certainly mainstream alternatives in both the agile and complexity communities having degrees of success much shorter cycles.

Loopy is a website that allows systems to be modelled dynamically. Like monitoring the population of wolves and deer, or hospital waiting times vs number of beds, or length of time in cars vs number of roads built.

Here is a model of depression and anxeity. It shows how A affects B, B affects C,  and C affects A, and how simple rules can become unpredictable quickly.

But reality rarely follows the model, and real life is complicated.

We can disrupt our models. Netflix, design their services so that any of the parts can fail and the service remains functional. They even have a 'Chaos Monkey' that randomly powers down parts of infrastructure. Coping with the removal of part of the system is designed into the system. Which is pretty cool, and the idea of a having bits of infrastructure powered down probably puts a few IT teams into a cold sweat.

Removing parts is rarely designed into our systems models though, I can't find the option in Loopy. Anyhow,, Removing parts isn't Chaos. 'Off switch Monkey' would be more appropriate. Reality can be far worse. Like a hacker stealing your shows.

What (else) could possibly go wrong?

Sometimes we provide 'training' to make a service better, but monitor and reward behaviour that negatively affects overall service. Like finishing calls in 5 mins or...  Maybe people don't behave like we expect them to. And then Chaos Money turns into a Black Swan, some highly unlikely event that no-one was going to predict. Or just a Blackish Swan, that was always there, but everyone was looking the other way.

Having a Chaos Monkey running in your system is extreme, but relatively easy and predictable. The real problems come when things don't work as the model says. Things stop talking to each other, or behave in the opposite way, or start to have the opposite effect you wanted.

I'd suggest there is a simple way to check if your system model to be Chaos Monkey proof, or Blackish Swan resistant or more. Does your system have people in it? if it does you need Chaos Monkeys and Blackish swans messing up your model.

People bring other problems too, including the Bias Baboon. Netflix doesn't have a Bias Baboon, as computers currently don't have biased (hello upcoming AI revolution), but people do all kinds of irrational things. Only people who want to use Facebook to influence how we vote seem to be modelling this at the moment.

So what does the Bias Baboon do?

Makes us thing really unlikely risks are likely.

Makes us fear losing what we have.

Makes us trust people who mirror us.
