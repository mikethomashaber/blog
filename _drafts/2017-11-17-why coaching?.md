# The coaching I offer

Non directive Clean Language coaching to work to get more of your strengths, find ways to get more of what you want, less of what you don't want.
Non direcitve means I won't tell you what to do. The questions I ask focus your attention on the outcomes you want.

We'll develop metaphors for how you work and act, and use these to help you get better.

Find out how you may be holding yourself back. A client described bundling up critisism of her work, and keeping it inside... immediately asking "Why am keeping critism inside? I need to just bundle it up and let it float away.."

Develop metaphors for how you work, what resources you'll need and how you'll know it's happening.

I'll not be listening to your problems and give you advice. I'll listen and direct your attention with questions that enable you to develop the solutions to your own problems.

# What's in the toolbox?

Let's get to work. Here's what I'll do: I'll use Symbolic Modeling to shine a light on how you operate. I'll ask, "When you are [verb]ing at your best....that's like what?" You decide what aspect of you that we'll explore. What's it like when you are learning at your best, plying your trade at your best, being an active citizen at your best, being centered or grounded at your best? You could pick anything you enjoy doing well, or not often enough, or anything that boosts your sense of equanimity, strength, or self-esteem. Any core activity. Over the course of our session, you describe, and I enquire further, until a clear, interactive metaphor forms that you can feel in your body.

For instance: when I facilitate this process for you at my best, that’s like me guarding over you with encouragement as you remember a forgotten swim stroke in a vast, warm, indoor pool. We are musically accompanied by Brian Eno’s Thursday Afternoon echoing over the PA system that lets us know take your time, there is no rush. We see by daylight from high windows. It's just you and me there. We are uninterrupted. It is safe. I am simultaneously swimming alongside you lap for lap, and watching from above as you move with increasing assuredness, remembering what your body knows.
