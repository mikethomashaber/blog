When working as a facilitator with groups it's important to do a Clean Setup that ensures that you are in the Neo-Cortex part of the brain.

Things that put me in the Reptillian Brain feeling like "I Can't Think", and the Mamillian Brain feeling like "I'm not Happy" need to be addressed before a session.

Knowing what pushes us into these states, and addresses these things in a Clean Setup is necessary when working with challenging groups.


## My Patterns, relating to Clifton Strenghts

## #1 Strategic

|Balcony|Basement|Examples||
|:------|:-------|-|-|
|Sees the way to go as well as alternatives and different paths|Overtly quick decisions|DRAMA- Others Ignoring shared purpose for gain||
|Intutive|Doesn't Connect the dots for others|Talking about ideas, going from 1 to 10 missing a lot of stages |Instead of (Gay) making sure I slowly take people from 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10 so that they don't miss a step and get lost.|
||Gets Stuck on a solution. Closed Minded| Creating my own solutions when there are good solutions available. Not taking the time to understand how what is available works|Bike stuff and shed bases|

## #2 Ideation

|Balcony|Basement|
|:-----------------------|:-------------------|
|Quick Thinker and Learner|Lacks follow through|
|Improves Things|Can't stick things out|
|Sees Connections|Creates more work|



## #3 individualization

|Balcony|Basement|Examples|
|:------|:-------| |
|Understands Uniqueness of all|Difficulty placing group above individual| This helps me stay off drama|
|Knows one size doesn't fit all|Difficulty making people decisions||
|Appreciated differences| |-|

## #4 Learner

|Balcony|Basement|
|:------|:-------|
|Loves Learning|Know it all|
|Quick to grasp new ideas|Doesn't produce results|
|Interested and intrigued by life|-|



## #5 Arranger

|Balcony|Basement|Examples||
|:------|:-------|||
|Makes sense of things|Doesn't like existing rules or procedures|*Dislikes being told what do*||
|Flexible|Changes Priority|I often prefer to wing it on meeting and workshops rather than be organized and have a plan|Too much planning is bad, but there needs to be enough|
|Able to Organize|Lacks Vision|||
|Constantly seeking best configuration| |-|-|

* ~~wanting to show the tools "hey look at these cogs" before showing what they are capable of.~~
  * talking about the coaching details after a coaching session
* ~~Talking about ideas, going from 1 to 10 missing a lot of stages~~
  * ~~Instead of (Gay) making sure I slowly take people from 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10 so that they don't miss a step and get lost.~~
* I have patterns during the day, where  I do better work at some times of the day. I have a lot of momentum first thing, but need to talk to people ideally. Can lose momentum entirely later on.
* ~~Creating my own solutions when there are good solutions available. Not taking the time to understand how what is available works.~~
  * ~~Bike stuff and shed bases.~~

* Making 'expensive mistakes' to reduce variety.
  * Like getting taxis.

* Ignoring peoples viewpoints if I don't 'like' them or if I'm tired. Just 'blanking' as if not worthy.

* I'm happy doing things inefficiently or long hand, even though I know and can design better ways to work
  * Using computer software badly
  * Not remembering commands and shortcuts

* ~~I often prefer to wing it on meeting and workshops rather than be organized and have a plan.~~
  * This can end badly
  * ~~Too much planning is bad, but there needs to be enough~~

* I don't like causing a fuss, or asking for what I'm entitled to. This may be because I don't like getting negative feedback.
  * didn't mention when a client didn't show - I case I had got it wrong and not to embarass someone

* I find it hard to update knowledge. When I know something it can be hard to revise this information when there is new ways.
 * So I can learn new things and then not keep up with progress
* Another way to put this is to say that I don't refactor
 * I keep going with the same Ideas. Refactoring is hard.

* I don't like having a plan when I am unsure of something.
 * I'll avoid planning. But I think I'm good with uncertainty.
 * Is it a particular type of uncertainty?

* I'm very bad at technical task switching
 * But seem to task switch all the time when learning

* I can withdraw help when I don't feel appreciated or acknowledged. Worse if my work or idea is mis-assigned to someone else

* I can close down with a default 'no action ' when stresses or unhappy

* I often start to argue in my head if something is bothering me, either made up arguments with the person I have problems with or more general arguments when there is a issue that isn't yet available to me.

* I don't like having to justify myself to people that I don't feel I need to give a justification to. I'd rather not justify myself and take the consequences. I may be trying to avoid being judged and so being told that what I'm doing doesn't have  worth.
 * For example, talking to the external consultancy people at work. I don't want to find out / care if they think the coaching I do is any good, or valuable. It's none of their business. Which may just be me being an arsehole.
 * Another example is preferring to pay for my own training, rather than ask for work to pay, as work is going to make a judgment as to if it is worthwhile. If they say no, then I pay for the training myself I end up in drama.s


### Organizational Models

* I know I should use daily lists - Even a daily Clean Setup, but I often don't

* Template and script ideas. Templates for stuff would rule. Even scripts





## Coaching Patterns
* I'm can be quite fast, wanting to move on quickly.

* My feedback tends to be quite technical.
 * This shows I appreciate technical competence
 * I guess I don't like technical incompetence, even it the results are good.
 * I'm not skilled enough to be able to judge technical competence
  * Sometimes when reading transcripts I think " I wouldn't have said that..."


# Reptillian Brain
## Getting into Reptillian
Getting a lot of unexpected information/perspectives.

Open hostility.

Unexpected domination of meetings

People overlooking or deliberately ignoring my contribution

Kids interrupting - causing information overload

Working and thinking hard for a long time and being tired.

Not having options, stress about times, locations and bookings. I make bad decisions.

Hearing misinterpreted facts

Changing plans with a poor reason (secondment)

## Getting out of Reptillian


# Mamillian Brain
## Getting into Mamillian
Ignoring shared purpose for other gains

I can interpret peoples actions as due to them making assumptions about my intelligence, perhaps because of memory, or need for written notes. I'm inferring this - it's my stuff.

I like to have multiple perspectives before acting

I can withdraw help when I feel it is not appreciated or acknowledged (kids and work)

I can bottle up "help" and often let out suggestions at the end of a meeting - often when I've not been asked, and I don't want to

I eat when I'm thinking or uncertain

Things that seem unfair can keep me in my mamillian brain.

## Getting out of Mamillian

# Neo-Cortex
## Getting into Neo-Cortex
I accept feedback from someone I trust, it's accurate (perhaps from a perspective I'm unaware of) and comes from someone who understands my values.

I often flick through options until I find one that fits. Some may not fit enough.

I feel a bit odd working on abstract things around the problem rather than tackling the problem directly - this is necessary. I need to talk about Elephants. That's not my Elephant!

I enjoy listening to people and, noticing important things, and formulating 'good' questions. With teams this will direct attention to one person for far too long.

To work at my best I feel I need to either be understood or have confidence.

Curious Team members or colleagues that I can have discussions with are vital. Without discussion with other people I can just spin my wheels. I need feedback and other perspectives.

# Making Good Decisions

Making good decisions requires me to understand the options and where they lead. Increasing the potential for a good outcome, and understanding the 'default' do nothing decision.
* In the work context I often default to 'default' do nothing by not asking and not following up ideas and conversations.
* In the study context I am risk taking, default yes, talking to people and offering to work together, increasing potential outcomes.
* I can make the work context more like the study context by being more open, default yes, risk taking, and communicating and following up ideas

* Making good decisions feels vulnerable, exposed, possibly wrong, excitement, trepidation

# Creating the conditions for the group to self model

* Get into a good state before the group starts
* Consider what the group needs to be in a good learning state
* Know what group members want
* Legitimise the idea that different people interppret things differently
* Train peoples attention on what is happening now
* Train peoples attention on what is adjacent to what is happening now.
* Introduce tools and models as a way to get people to pay attention to one another. It's not about them learning to pay attention to the learning or the tools
* Shift between everyday conversation and the hidden symbolic world and back again
* Detect patterns in individuals and across the group
* Build a network of attention around central themes that makes the most of all participants
* Get the group familiar with tools and models before you introduce them formally
* Developp simple rules that work for most of them, most of the time
* Put in place the conditions this particular group will need to continue self-modelling without you
