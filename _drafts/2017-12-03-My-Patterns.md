title: My Patterns
---

When working as a facilitator with groups it's important to do a Clean Setup that ensures that you are in the Neo-Cortex part of the brain.

Things that put me in the Reptillian Brain feeling like "I Can't Think", and the Mamillian Brain feeling like "I'm not Happy" need to be addressed before a session.

Knowing what pushes us into these states, and addresses these things in a Clean Setup is necessary when working with challenging groups.

## My Patterns
* wanting to show the tools "hey look at these cogs" before showing what they are capable of.
* Talking about ideas, going from 1 to 10 missing a lot of stages
 * Instead of (Gay) making sure I slowly take people from 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10 so that they don't miss astep and get lost.
* I have patterns during the day, where  I do better work at some times of the day. I have a lot of momentum first thing
* Creating my own solutions when there are good solutions available. Not taking the time to understand how what is available works.
Bike stuff and shed bases.

* Making 'expensive mistakes' to reduce variety.
Like getting taxis.

* Ignoring peoples viewpoints if I don't 'like' them or if I'm tired. Just 'blanking' as if not worthy.

# Reptillian Brain
## Getting into Reptillian
Getting a lot of unexpected information/perspectives.

Open hostility.

Unexpected domination of meetings

People overlooking or deliberately ignoring my contribution

Kids interrupting - causing information overload

Working and thinking hard for a long time and being tired.

Not having options, stress about times, locations and bookings. I make bad decisions.

Hearing misinterpreted facts

# Mamillian Brain
## Getting into Mamillian
Ignoring shared purpose for other gains

I can interpret peoples actions as due to them making assumptions about my intelligence, perhaps because of memory, or need for written notes. I'm inferring this - it's my stuff.

I like to have multiple perspectives before acting

I can withdraw help when I feel it is not appreciated or acknowledged (kids and work)

I can bottle up "help" and often let out suggestions at the end of a meeting - often when I've not been asked, and I don't want to

I eat when I'm thinking or uncertain

Things that seem unfair can keep me in my mamillian brain.

## Getting out of Mamillian

# Neo-Cortex
## Getting into Neo-Cortex
I accept feedback from someone I trust, it's accurate (perhaps from a perspective I'm unaware of) and comes from someone who understands my values.

I often flick through options until I find one that fits. Some may not fit enough.

I feel a bit odd working on abstract things around the problem rather than tackling the problem directly - this is necessary. I need to talk about Elephants. That's not my Elephant!

I enjoy listening to people and, noticing important things, and formulating 'good' questions. With teams this will direct attention to one person for far too long.

To work at my best I feel I need to either be understood or have confidence.

Curious Team members or colleagues that I can have discussions with are vital. Without discussion with other people I can just spin my wheels. I need feedback and other perspectives.

# Making Good Decisions

Making good decisions requires me to understand the options and where they lead. Increasing the potential for a good outcome, and understanding the 'default' do nothing decision.
* In the work context I often default to 'default' do nothing by not asking and not following up ideas and conversations.
* In the study context I am risk taking, default yes, talking to people and offering to work together, increasing potential outcomes.
* I can make the work context more like the study context by being more open, default yes, risk taking, and communicating and following up ideas

* Making good decisions feels vulnerable, exposed, possibly wrong, excitement, trepidation

# Creating the conditions for the group to self model

* Get into a good state before the group starts
* Consider what the group needs to be in a good learning state
* Know what group members want
* Legitimise the idea that different people interppret things differently
* Train peoples attention on what is happening now
* Train peoples attention on what is adjacent to what is happening now.
* Introduce tools and models as a way to get people to pay attention to one another. It's not about them learning to pay attention to the learning or the tools
* Shift between everyday conversation and the hidden symbolic world and back again
* Detect patterns in individuals and across the group
* Build a network of attention around central themes that makes the most of all participants
* Get the group familiar with tools and models before you introduce them formally
* Developp simple rules that work for most of them, most of the time
* Put in place the conditions this particular group will need to continue self-modelling without you
