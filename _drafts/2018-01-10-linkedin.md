I work as a Digital Information Model Developer, using linked data and semantic tools. Starting with User Journeys models and end to end understanding of the processes and systems that are currently in place. The Digital Catalyst Strategy is looking beyond service silos into journeys using linked data.

I'm happiest working towards the people end of systems, but I have a deep understanding of the technology stack that underpins what we do.

I'm constantly learning, and updating my skills. I'm currently working towards a ILM qualification in Clean Language Coaching, I've completed Certified Agile Leadership AL1, and I have an MSc level Certificate of Systems Thinking in Practice from the Open University.

These coaching and leadership skills are essential for working in complex fast moving situations that involve meeting peoples needs with technology.

Deep Modeling skills are essential for an understanding of the interactions of the full technology stack we use to link cloud and on premise services. To do this I use a range of systemic strategic mapping and modeling tools to understand the social and technology environment my team works in.
