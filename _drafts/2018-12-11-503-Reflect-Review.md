# 1.1 Conduct an Evidence Based Assesment Analysis of your own ability
##From feedback, evaluations, reflections on SWOT and action Plan
Session #1
This was a tricky session, with lots of problems. David wanted to look at his employment future.
 Used PRO model to move to Outcomes, but then David moved straight back to problems. Attempted to develop some metaphors, but often got problems, (for example a +ve journey was 'maybe something I don't want to pursue'). Ended positively, with David needing to take time over a considered decision, was like "Becoming in control" and he'd see and hear advice from parter, family and friends.
## Knowledge
KN1 Remembering the PRO model
KN2 Remembering the Target model
## Skills
SK1 Kept Calm and feeling in control, despite not getting metaphors to develop.

## Behaviour
BE1 Was non judgemental, David asked for a 2nd session.
