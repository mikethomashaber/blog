# Coaching Diary  Sunday 17th September 2017

The goal was to use the Clean Setup as a Coaching Plan. I misunderstood, and only used the 3 Clean Setup questions, instead of developing metaphors.

*During the Clean Setup for the day I'd mentioned that my brain could get full, and I could get overwhelmed.
As a development task I'd try to recognise when I was getting full, maybe get fresh air, go for a shower or a walk.*

This didn't work too well, as I still got full.

#### Development task
*Read and annotate the Types of questions, and understand the purpose of asking them*

I did this, and found resources further in the course to explain when to use the questions, for example in the PRO model or when coaching off Drama.
