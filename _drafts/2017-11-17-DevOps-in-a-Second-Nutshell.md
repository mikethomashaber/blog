In this post I'll tie together some ideas that I think are connected, look at patterns of behaviour and what they achieve, and look at how understanding practise and theory helps us to get better through double loop leaning.

1st I'll write some of the things I believe:

Understanding the world using models is great.
Also all models are wrong.
We will need to use multiple models at the same time, these may contradict.
This fine because
The world is complex, and outcomes are unknowable in advance, even when we can explain the past. Outcomes emerge from complex interactions, so our models help us see how we got here, and may help us understand how things are disposed to behave, but they don't predict the future.
2nd some of ideas I'll use

Complex Adaptive Systems

Multiple correct perspectives and worldviews on the same situation

Ashby's Law Requisite Variety

3rd some cartoons



Dev Ops 3 ways

 
 
First Way is Systems Thinking

To learn more, this is the name given to Systems Dynamics in American Schools K12
Flow: Look at the space between things rather than the things themselves
Things emerge from the way they are structured
Conway's law says work emerges from the way that Teams are structured
Or the way communication is structured
But doesn't help designing team structures
Design for requisite variety withing teams
RV in teams includes variety in perspectives and strengths
Maybe even variety in purpose ie advocates for different perspectives on success
Or the team may not be able to meet challenges or react and purpose to a changing environment
*re purpose see double loop learning
That are responsible for things within defined boundaries
p21Organise teams to reduce handoffs in the value stream - for fast comms and flow
Efficiency (or Lean)
Efficiency is great where it is required, and parts of an organisation need to be efficient.  It means getting good at something and making money.
Usually working like a machine
Accounting / payroll is a great place for this
But there is a trap, efficiency builds it's own demise
Lose the ability to absorb variety
And build the biases that you are right that may stop you from seeing when you need to change with your environment
The second way: amplify feedback loops.

Feedback loop become more robust with disruptions
Which could be called anti-fragility
p30 diagnose and treat problems so they cannot reoccur
Feedback loops to automate testing quickly
enables learning, through fast feedback
Where they are smaller and easier to correct
Feedback loops to improve culture
swarming to fix problems
and to aid learning as close to the problem as possible
Feedback allows us to steer - align and re align to purpose


The third way: culture of continual experimentation and learning

Double loop learning
Which is not only getting better at what you are doing
But questioning what you are doing against your purpose
If you have the variety of perspectives in your team and you understand how what you do supports the organisation in a changing environment
If you don't know why you're using an approach, how can you use double loop learning to see if it is correct?

Flow and Stuff

Flow is a metaphor. It suggests water with work flowing smoothly without hindrance. But are our organisations more like boats, traversing the flows and currents? The greek work kubernetes is the skills of steersmanship - reacting to the forces of wind and tide on navigating a desired path. Kubernetes is also the base of cybernetics.

Regarding steersmanship, no one spends months planning the exact direction to set off in, and the times and dates of any actions along the way, so that they arrive at their destination correctly. But there are people in our organisations who are good at planning, and other who are great at following a plan exactly. These are useful skills. But if you people strong in these skills paln your voyage, you may be in trouble. If needing to change course is seen as a failure to plan (and plan to fail!) then people may choose to carry on with the plan rather than lose face. You could be on a death march.

DevOps is more than just Dev and Ops. It's the recognition that developing and running software is complex and unknowable. It recognises that a different approach is required to planning and execution. That approach looks like adaptability and learning, and following a purpose rather than a plan. You may need people with different skills to do this. Or you may find your best PM's were the ones who adapted their plans the best.

Patterns

You wrote it, you support it. This is skin in the game. If a developer can put a change live, knowing that Operations will get out of bed to fix it, does they have skin in the game?

This is a huge challenge for siloed organisations and gated workflows. There is safety in knowing what you have to do, and being able to deliver it exactly, knowing that if you do this you won't be blamed for failure.

You have reduced the variery you have to deal with. Given the choice who would want to make the decisions, but have someone else responsible for the consequences? This is hard coded in some organisational design, and often those at the bottom of the heirarchy chart absorb all the problems. Often as BAU. Anyone who is responsable for a lot, and accountable for a little is going to strongly resist any changes, and they may be powerful enought to derail a DevOps implemetation. They are unlikely to be helf accountable for this.

How much time is spent in organisations discussing where the boundaries of decision taking is, and the boundaries for dealiing with the outcomes. Are desicion makers held to account? Does having to hold someone to account mean they had no skin the game in the first place?

pattern

No blame fixing. Aircraft industry. Literal skin in the game of keeping planes flying.

Swarm to fix problems, whoever broke it. It could be you next time, so this builds culture, and if you do what it takes so the problem doesn't happen again it's feedback that makes you less fragile.

Pay back technical debt:

In a changing enviroment, with changing goals

What if we do all this, and it's still not working? They way we talk and interact, and the way we are treated affects how we work. Notts Test, seeing systems.



Metaphors

Treat machines like machine

p9 predictatable and mechanistic, near zero defects
Automate everything in the value stream that can be automated
Treat people like complex adaptive systems
