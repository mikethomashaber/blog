title: Why do they hate us?
--

When we do almost anything, we are likely trying something that has been done before, and are looking to change or fix something that was a change of fix itself. If something isn't working for us, it will be working for some people.

Changes and ideas can fail because we fail to understand different points of view, or ignore them to simplify a situation. Ignoring perspectives is a way to make decision making easier. It's these different understanding of the situation that can become our undoing.

We can use a set of questions called Critical Systems Heuristics (CSH) to question the decisions we have made, and try to understand "Why do they hate us?", or simply want us to fail.

CSH questions the boundaries of our decision making including
* Who (is in the boundary of what) matters?
* What (is in the boundary of what) success is?
* What (is in the boundary of the) skills we'll need to succeed?

There are 12 questions, asked from different perspectives and worldviews. CSH is thorough, but there are a lot of questions!

We answer the CSH questions ourselves, and then the need to be answered by others. Assuming we can answer them from perspective and values of others is a bias that we think we know what others are thinking. This is not true.
We ought to take great care if we answer on behalf of others.

The CSH questions cover the Motivation, Power, Knowledge and Legitimacy of those in control of  the change.
