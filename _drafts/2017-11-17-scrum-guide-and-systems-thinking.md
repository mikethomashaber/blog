An explanation of Scrum and the organisational anti-patterns it aims to avoid.

From The Scrum Guide (tm)

The Scrum Team

The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master. Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team.

A scrum team needs to have requisite variety.

The Product Owner

Manages Backlog
Accountable
Responsible for what the team does
Prioritisation of Backlog
Resource Bargains at Sprint Planning
Visible Decisions
The product owner needs serious skills to do this well. SODA mapping and understanding boundaries with CSH may help.

The Development Team

Development Teams Organise and Manage their own work
They represent themselves in Sprint Planning in the resource bargain with the Product Owner
The Scrum Master

Scrum Masters ensure that the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices, and rules. The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways.

And serves the team in several ways:

Scrum Events

each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt something. These events are specifically designed to enable critical transparency and inspection. Failure to include any of these events results in reduced transparency and is a lost opportunity to inspect and adapt.

The Sprint

Sprints contain and consist of the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the
Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.
During the Sprint:

Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development
Team as more is learned. Resource Bargain - Brick without straw etc.

Each Sprint has a definition of what is to be built, a design and flexible plan that will guide building it, the work, and the resultant product.
