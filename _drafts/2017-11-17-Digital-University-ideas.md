title: Systems Ideas for a Digital University

#Question: What could a Digital Future look like for Universities?
I'm going to assume a familiarity with some not yet mainstream tools like Stafford Beers VSM, Patterns of Strategy, Wardley Maps, to look at organisations)

A Digital Future can be taken to broadly mean how 'Software is eating the World'. Organisations with non software strategies are likely to be put of out existence by digital organisations that meets users needs better and cheaper using software based strategies.

Digital organsations often have another element to their strategy of meeting users needs better and cheaper. They have a strategy of changing the environment they operate in. Software based operations are combined with legaslative efforts to outflank taxi regulations with Uber, and to influence drone legislation by Amazon. The aim is to make their environment better for them and worse for their competitors.

Universities have massive legacy non software teaching models, based on physical infrastucture and people.  A digital strategy for a current University is quite different than for an organisation moving into the sector without a physical presence.

There are advantages and disadvantages to each position, that can be modelled by looking how each organisation relates to it's environment.

<Patterns of Strategy Stuff>

## Looking at VSM System 1's / Primary Operations
A digital strategy for a University can look at leveraging software alongside
* Applying Systems Thinking questions
 * Should we even be doing this?
* If yes Then
 * Use Lean tools and software first

## Looking at System 5 / Identity
What will education look like in a digital environment? How is our identity affected by our structural  coupled relationships with our environment through our primary operations? What is the required set of activities that are necessary for our identity?

How do this Identity affect us and our competitors? It's worth noting here that our competitors can and will pivot to new business models as they arise, and this can totally change their identity. (see flickr). A University will find it difficult to pivot to new System 1 operations, however lucrative, if they affect the identity of a/the University.

A strategy is required that look at our current operations (VSM system 3) and the future operations requirements (VSM System 4), in the context of the environment we work in and the actions of our competitors, both operationally, and altering the environment we share.

The envoronent is Complex and adaptive. The value here is not using tools to predict the future. It's in structured deep thinking that is required, and how this can aid future actions.

There is a rich, if less well known set of tools to look at this.
We can use the VSM to understand our primary activities, identity and how resources for current and future operations are balanced.

We can use SODA to understand how our identity can be achieved by aiming for goals. These goals require decisions on strategic options, and the model can be used to understand what we should do today, to have vertical coherence to our goals.

We should have a SODA model for each recursive level of the VSM, aligning the  current and future work of the System1's with the identity driven goals for each level.

Wardley maps provide amazing insights at each level too. In a University I'd suggest there needs to maps for each primary activity. In practice we find that certain University courses are being dragged faster down the industrialisation axis than others. Wardley mapping shows how this may happen, and gives us ideas for strategies to speed up or slow down the movement. 

### Understanding ourselves, our competitors and our environment.

All of the above requires software tools. We're modelling real life here with all it's contradictions, so a semantic data model is required. Semantic models do not insist on truth.
