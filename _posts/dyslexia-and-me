This is post 1 of a possible series.

I grew up before dyslexia was really a thing. I went through school with scruffy writing, bad concentration and a lack of attention to detail. Living in a town dominated by heavy industry, maths, science and metalwork were the thing working class boys did. So that's what I did. My strategy was largely one of applying myself and banging my head against the problem until I figured it out. I assumed everyone else was the same.

I now know I don't learn things in the way that schools teach them. I don't learn formulas and apply them to isolated problems, and build up a set of tools to apply at exam time.

I seemed to spend most of the time not really getting it, and taking my place in the class pecking order. I'd often find that things just clicked before the exam, and suddenly it all made sense. Rather than remembering the formulas, I was understanding why they worked and how they all fit together. This happened by force of will. I wasn't a natural, but I worked hard. Partly because I assumed everyone else was working  hard, and partly because I really, really wanted to get out of that town.

My education served me OK I guess. I learned the principals of how computer systems should be built, and then I knew how they were likely to work, without needed to be told. Especially for GNU/Linux, a system built on meritocracy and doing things right.

I still had to fight to get the details into my head though, and this required overlearning.

Then a few events led to me reading about dyslexia and getting an assessment.

The results were that compared to my expected ability due to IQ I read at about 50% of the expected speed. My writing is about 50% too, and my short term memory is pretty poor.

I assumed this was all part of the same intelligence level, but it seems that once I understand something I really get it. Especially things that involve

mental modelling
sorting through potential outcomes
understanding narratives, and thinking "what must have happened for this to be true?"
I'm really good at those. And like I assumed people had to work as hard as me to learn stuff, I assumed they could see the things I could see. But that's not the case.

More in part 2.
