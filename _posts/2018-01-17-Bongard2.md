# Solving Bongard Problems
Quick Overview:
Mikhail Bongard invented a type of puzzle called a Bongard Problem. These are interesting because you get to see all the answers. You need to work out the question. With the origonal Bongard problems there are two sets of six images. The solution to the problem is the explanation of the difference between the two.

Bongard problems are of interest to people who want to understand how we think. The book Goedel Escher Bach provides a methodology for solving Bongard problems.
An example of this methodology from the book may look like. Note that this methodology is wrong for the problem that is being solved.

Mikhail Bongards book Pattern Matching (CHECK) has one hundred problems, we can keep adding to the heuristics with each problem solved. We can build a list of all the heuristics we need. In this way there are two different approaches available to someone new to the problems.

This first approach is when you don't know what the potential rules are. For example you don't if there is a rule that "If the pictures were physical, and upright, their center of gravity would make them unstable". (example)

The potential number of solutions is unlimited, and you're going to invent some potential solutions that are not used.

The second approach is when you're given the heuristics before you start to solve the problems. This doesn't make the problems trivial, but it's a different type of problem.

### Distinctions
I'll use a distinction between knowing all the solutions in advance in the following three examples. I'll then add the extra case where you think you know all the answers. Or put another way, you have a consistent explanation for how things work.

I'll use three examples, playing Zendo, a game based on Bongard problems, and two of what I'll call real world Bongard problems. I'll offer examples of how we approach them when we think we have all the rules, and what happens when we're faced with the knowledge that we don't have all the rules.

## Example 1: Zendo.
Zendo is a board game based on Bongard games, using inductive logic. It used 3 shapes in three colours, and the idea is that a particular configuration is given on a card, and players need to create structure that follow the rule on the card, and win by correctly guessing the rule.

## Example 2: Strategy
Consider the case when a company makes some strategic actions. What is their strategy? There will be some visible action, so you'll have a before state, an after state, and you need the strategy that links the two.
If you can figure out their strategy you can react to it with your own. If you fail you may go out of business.

## Examples 3: Computer Crime
In this article David Gilbertson describes a way that the he's hidden some code to harvest credit card details in a website that the reader may either own or use. Most website use frameworks that have a load of code imported in to the pages. The hack is viable.

Im this example one half of the Bongard problem is your unhacked site, the other is a hacked version, and you need heurists to prove that there is a difference. Ie You've not been hacked. I'm maybe pushing the example here.

The author goes through the ways that would be used to discover the exploit code. These ways are like the heuruistics to solve the problem.
David then systematically shows how each of our ways of finding the code is flawed. We thought we had a full set of heuristcs, but it's clear we don't.  We can't choose whether to learn our knowledge is flawed, it's forced upon us. It's a painful read, and it probably makes people angry enough to prove him wrong!

## What happens when I play Zendo
When I got Zendo I chose not to look at the cards describing the patterns, and I didn't show the family. We started from scratch. It was impossible to play. So I told everyone what the pieces were called and the orientation, Wedge, cheese, tower, and the the number, colour and layout of the pieces would matter. We now had a vocabulry and did some of the easy questions.

When my eldest decided to choose a medium difficulty question we started with the usual guesses, and then, as we didn't seem to be getting close we started to get agitated. We didn't know the rules. The temptation to ask for a clue or to give up was huge. I'd suggest we didn't want to have to learn, and we had an easy option to not learn.

# Strategy
In business our competitors strategies are unknown to use. They may be easy to spot, or they may confound us.(Patterns of Strategy). There are examples of strategies (Wardley, Hoverstadt) We can't ask for a clue, but we can 'give up' by just carrying on what we're doing, head in the sand. We think our strategy is fine. Note that both Wardley and Hoverstadt show us sets of strategies, but neither is the full set. We know there are more possibilities out there.


## What's happening in these examples
Thanks to Andrew J Barker (@ajbkr) from Tech Nottingham Slack for the pointer here.
What is happening when we face an inductive logic puzzle and we don't know the full range of answers? I'd suggest that we're not just learning the answer, but we may be doing a form of double loop learning. Our current problem solving skills are not enough. We need to recognize this, and by trial and error get some new ones.

This is why we get angry when playing Bongard games, and we don't know the range of answers, and why we don't do strategy well.

Double loop learning is not just realizing there is something to learn, like a computer language, or musical instrument. It's learning that your old tools don't work on the problem you're facing, and maybe never really did. You need to make a fundamental change, and can't go back.

There is usually an unavoidable event that triggers this sort of learning. Maybe your business fails, and you see how it was obvious there were problems, if only you'd seen them. It's maybe hard to even imagine what it would be like not to know. The past is another country. Maybe your partner leaves you unexpectedly, and one you see the reason you kick yourself for not seeing it. Or maybe your secure website gets compromised.

I think this sort of unavoidable situation that can't be explained by your current knowledge is almost always required for double loop learning.

## Anti Fragile People
Double loop learning, as presented above is Anti Fragility. Some event that could break a fragile version of 'us', or be endured by a robust 'us' actually makes us stronger when we learn from it. But it may almost break us first.

So what is stopping us getting over the double loop learning wall and being Anti Fragile? And what can help us over the wall.
Single loop learnign feels so much better than double loop learning. Double loop learnign required we get past the cognitive bias that says we have a consistent explanation for how the bits of the world we care about works.


## What's stopping us

We're stopping ourselves.

## What can help us

Unavoidable feedback from hard failures*.


## Firstly, what's stopping us.
There is a useful (but ultimately wrong) model of how our brains work, called the Triuine Brain. This suggests that there are 3 areas, or thinking states that we use. The lowest brain is the Reptilian brain. This is the fight or flight response. Knowing we are safe keeps this brain quiet. Feeling unsafe activates this brain. Physically safe, but also mentally 'safe'. 'Don't worry' it tells us. 'You've got the answers'. Fight also can mean get angry...

If our Reptillian Brain is happy we can use the Mamillian Brain. This brain has higher functions, and is kept happy by knowing the rules. This can be social rules, where the loos are. Not knowing the rules puts you in this brain.

If you're safe, and you know the rules, then you can use the Neo-Cortex, or learning brain. I'm going to suggests that this is more accurately called the Single Loop Learning Brain. You can learn a new Language, or how to use your current skills better.

## Stick with me, I'm about to put all this together.

### Example 1: Zendo
We're playing a game. It's supposed to be fun. But we're only know a few of the possible answers. We don't know the rules. We're in Mamillian brain. We're not happy. It's not terrible, but it's not exactly fun either. We want to be in our Neo Cortex, getting the answers right. We ask for a clue from the player who knows the answer.

Before we play again we look at all the cards with the answers on. The game is now to remember these and pick the right one. You can do this, we're an expert. It's fun.

## Example 2: Strategy

Wardley gives an amazing list of strategies, but says there are more. Is it a complete list?

With the full list is strategy work in our neo-cortex, an expert matching the strategy? Or during analysis do we come up with new strategies that are likely to be wrong in the particular example?
Is having a complete list a barrier to your brain double loop leaning?



Does this article offer any double loop learning. Why is this article wrong?


* Clean Feedback. Firstly make development tasks as small as possible whilst being visible so you can't pretend. Then use clean feedback to see how you're doing. Clean feedback avoids the barriers going up when we are threatened, opening a way in for the feedback. It's doesn't exactly feel nice, but it works.
