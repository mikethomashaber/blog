# Solving Bongard Problems
GEB provides a methodology for solving Bongard problems. Given that Mikhail Bongards book has one hundred problems, we can keep adding to the heuristics with each problem solved. In this way there are two different approaches available to someone new to the problems.

This first is when you don't know what the potential rules are. So, for example you don't if there is a rule that "If the pictures were physical, and upright, their centre of gravity would make them unstable".

The potential number of solutions is not limited.

When you've solved all one hundred problems then you have all the rules for that set. If you're given these potential rules before you've solved the problems then there is a limited number of solutions. This doesn't make the problems trivial, but it's a different type of problems.

I'll use three examples, a game based on Bongard problems, and two of what I call real world bongard problems, and how we approach them when we think we have all the rules, and what happens when we're faced with the knowledge that we don't have all the rules.

## Example 1: Zendo.
Zendo is a board game based on Bongard games, using inductive logic. It used 3 shapes in three colours, and the idea is that a particular configuration is given on a card, and players need to create structure that follow the rule on the card, and win by correctly guessing the rule.

## Example 2: Strategy
Consider the case when a company makes some actions. What is their strategy? If you can figure out their strategy you can react. If you fail you may go out of business. There are many examples of businesses who have failed, or refused to understand a competitors strategy, or change their own.

## Examples 3: Computer Crime
This article describes a viable way that the author could have hidden some code to harvest credit card details from a website that the reader may either own or use. He then goes through the ways that would be used to discover the code. These ways are like the potential solutions to the bongard problems.
He then systematically shows how each of our ways of finding the code is flawed. We can't choose to learn our knowledge and understanding is flawed, it's forced upon us.

## What's happening in these examples
Thanks to Andrew J Barker from Tech Nottingham Slack for the pointer here.
What is happening when we face an inductive logic puzzle where we don't know the full range of answers a solution may come from? I'd suggest that this is not just learning the answer, but a form of double loop learning. Our current problem solving are not enough, we need to recognize this, and by trial and error get some new ones.

Double loop learning is not just realizing there is something to learn, like a computer language, or musical instrument. It's learning that your old tools don't work on the problem you're facing, and maybe never really did. You need to make a fundamental change, and can't go back.

There is usually an unavoidable event that triggers this sort of learning. Maybe your business fails, and you see how it was obvious there were problems, if only you'd seen them. Maybe your partner leaves you unexpectedly, and one you see the reason you kick yourself for not seeing it. Or maybe your secure website gets compromised.

I think this sort of unavoidable situation that can't be explained by your current knowledge is required for double loop learning.

## Anti Fragile People
Double loop learning, as presented above is Anti Fragility. Some event that could break a fragile version of 'us', or be endured by a robust 'us' actually makes us stronger.

So what is stopping us getting over the double loop learning wall and being Anti Fragile? And what can help us over the wall.



## What's stopping us

We're probable stopping ourselves, and I'll use Examples 1,2 and to describe how.

## What can help us

Unavoidable feedback on Failure. Either actual hard failure, or something called Clean Feedback.


## Firstly, what's stopping us.
There is a useful (but ultimately wrong) model of how our brains work, called the Triuine Brain. This suggests that there are 3 areas, or thinking states that we use. The lowest brain is the Reptilian brain. This is the fight or flight response. Knowing we are safe keeps this brain quiet. Feeling unsafe activates this brain. Physically safe, but also mentally 'safe'. 'Don't worry' it tells us. 'You've got the answers'. Fight also can mean get angry...

If our Reptillian Brain is happy we can use the Mamillian Brain. This brain has higher functions, and is kept happy by knowing the rules. This can be social rules, where the loos are. Not knowing the rules puts you in this brain.

If you're safe, and you know the rules, then you can use the Neo-Cortex, or learning brain. I'm going to suggests that this is more accurately called the Single Loop Learning Brain. You can learn a new Language, or how to use your current skills better.

## Stick with me, I'm about to put all this together.
