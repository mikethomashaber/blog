Looking at working groups of 'consultants' for example law firms. Since these exist they must be viable. Looking at how they do this my provide ideas.

Unless peoples needs are met they may sabotage plans. Understand peoples needs when they join the organization, and what positive and negative actions they may be capable of.

Members of the organization need to have skin in the game with their behavior and their work. They need to be personally positively & negatively affected by their positive and negative behavior.

You don't want people whose needs may be met by doing things that may not be good for the organization. For example consider external consultants making themselves indispensable for future work.

To be viable, consultancy organization needs to do a number of 'system one' things
* marketing
** Different client segements
** Different types of marketing
* find potential clients
* follow up & convert potential clients
* planning interventions
* working with clients
* follow up with clients
* payments and accounting

These system one activities may be done by different people, and they may not directly bring in money from the client. Members of the organisation may have strengths in some areas more than others.

The following co-ordination needs to be done
* ensuring consultants are available for work when required
* ensure intervention planning has done on time & quality

The work needs to be done, and credited correctly, ideally by someone with skin the the game of doing it correctly, and not creating unwanted dynamics in the organization.

There are a number of environments that a consultancy works with
* Potential clients
* Current clients
* Past clients
* Other (rival) consultancies using similar approach
* Other (rival) consultancies using different approaches
* Marketing organizations
* Industry publications
