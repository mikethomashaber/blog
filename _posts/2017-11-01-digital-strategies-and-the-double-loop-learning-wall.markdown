What's the difference between a Strategy and a Digital strategy? Haven't we been using IT strategically for years? We have Chief Digital Officers? What does it all mean?

I'll use a definition of strategy that "it's what you do to change your environment so that it's in your favor". Like choosing the territory in which a battle is to take place, or lobbying so your products are have preferential treatment. There are other definitions too.

I like the definition of a Digital Strategy is suggested by Mike Bracken formely of the CO-OP Â https://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3013897/businesses-are-using-digital-transformation-purely-for-marketing-purposes-says-co-op-cdo-mike-bracken

> "It's a much over-used term but what it really means is resetting the operations and culture of the organisation around the digital needs of its users and customers, and doing so in a way that means that they are accelerated and they meet the high expectations that digital provides," he says.

and the good bit

> "Digital transformation involves asking some very basic questions of yourself like: should we even do this anymore? Why are we set up this way? How can we do something different? What are the real user needs that our customers have?"

Taking this definition, implementing a digital strategy as suggested by Mike Bracken pits us against Chris Argyris's issues with double loop learning. -

If you're questioning moving to a new digital strategy then you are successful with a non digital strategy, and you must be viable in the short to medium term. You fit the profile of Argyis's successful person who find it hard to learn.


Argysis suggests the double loop learning gets less likely the more successful you are. Another way to put this is that *failure helps us learn*. Failure may even be necessary to learn, it forces us to cross over the wall to ask difficult questions that our brains would prefer we didn't ask. Defensive Reasoning get in the way and we assume the problem is not with us, but out there. https://squiretothegiants.wordpress.com/2017/08/03/double-trouble/

Argysis covers this extensiveely in "Teaching Smart People how to Learn". He suggests that success at school and university sets up high flyers to succeed. In order to easily grade students they are given problems that have solutions. A problem that doesn't have a neat solution is the problem of the teacher. Once out of school, Argysis's high flyers blame clients, managers, anyone but themselves.

Back to digital strategy, the questions Mike Bracken suggests are unlikely to be answered by people who are conditioned to success. It's easier to say the framing of the question is wrong. Digital doesn't mean questioning your assumptions. It means a new marketing campaign, or an app.

If you've been in business a while, you may need to start questioning "Should be even do this anymore?", "Why are we set up this way?". Because online companies with deep pockets are looking at your business, and are able to quickly test alternatives to your business model until they find one that works. They are also using the definition of strategy used at the start of this article. They are changing the environment so that it is in their favour.
