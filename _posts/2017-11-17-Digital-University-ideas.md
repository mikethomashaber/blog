title: Systems Ideas for a Digital University

# Question: What could a Digital Future look like for Universities?
I'm going to assume a familiarity with some *not yet mainstream* tools like Stafford Beers Viable Systems Model (VSM), Strategic Options Development and Analysis (SODA) and Patterns of Strategy(Hoverstadt and Loe) alongside Wardley Maps and other techniques to look at organisations.

Digital Future can be taken to broadly mean the future where 'Software is eating the World'. Organisations with non software strategies are likely to be put of out existence by digital organisations that meets users needs better and cheaper using software based strategies.
In the education sector, digital organisations include coursera, udemy, nano degrees and in the future possibly Google and Amazon.

## Digital Operations
Digital organisations meeting users needs better and cheaper by using Information Technology to redduce the variety problems in operations. Digital organsations usually have a strategy of changing the environment they operate in.

## Changing Digital Environment
Software based operations are combined with legaslative efforts to outflank taxi regulations with Uber, and to influence drone legislation by Amazon. The aim is to make their environment better for them and worse for their competitors.

## Current Organisations
Universities have massive legacy non software teaching models, based on physical infrastucture and people.  A digital strategy for a current University is quite different than for an organisation moving into the sector without a physical presence. Universities would be unwise to copy a strategy from a native digital organisations.

### Looking at Primary Operations /  VSM System 1's
A digital strategy for a University can look at leveraging software alongside
* Applying Systems Thinking questions
 * Should we even be doing this? (but see post on double loop learning)
* and if yes then
 * Use Lean tools and a "software first" approach

### Looking at Identity / VSM System 5
What will education look like in a digital environment? How is our identity affected by our structural  coupled relationships with our environment through our primary operations? What is the required set of activities that are necessary for our identity?

How do this Identity affect us and our competitors? It's worth noting here that our competitors can and will pivot to new business models as they arise, and this can totally change their identity. (see flickr). A University will find it difficult to pivot to new System 1 operations, however lucrative, if they affect the identity of a/the University.


### Balancing what we do now and in the future / VSM 3 and 4
A strategy is required that look at our current operations (VSM system 3) and the future operations requirements (VSM System 4)
* in the context of the environment we work in
* and the actions of our competitors
* operationally
* and with each side altering the shared environment

The environment is Complex and Adaptive System. *We are not using tools to predict the future*. The value is in structured deep thinking that is required and how this can aid future decisions whose constraints and options we can attempt to influence.


## Strategies for the Environment
There are advantages and disadvantages to Universities, and digital disruptors, that can be modelled by looking how each organisation relates to each other via their shared environment. Patterns of Strategy does this, by looking how Universities and online competitors affect their environment in terms of their
* Rate of Change
* Power
* Agility
* Innovation  

It can be seen applying Patterns of Strategy that while a lot of Power and momentum lie with traditional Universities, the ability to rapidly innovate, define the future, and work to change the environment lie with digital innovators.


## Other Tools
There is a rich, if less well known set of tools to look at this.
As described, we can use the VSM to understand our primary activities, identity and how resources for current and future operations are balanced.

We can use SODA to understand how our identity can be achieved by aiming for goals. These goals require decisions on strategic options, and the model can be used to understand what we should do today, to have vertical coherence to our goals.

We should have a SODA model for each recursive level of the VSM, aligning the current and future operational work of the System 1's with  identity driven goals for each level.

At each level of recursion, Wardley maps provide amazing insights too. In a traditional University I'd suggest there needs to maps for each primary activity. So in practice we find that certain University courses are being dragged faster down the industrialisation axis than others. Wardley mapping shows how this may happen, and gives us ideas for strategies to speed up or slow down the movement.
