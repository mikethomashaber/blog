## Karpman Drama Triangle
On the Drama Triangle there is Persecutor Rescuer and Victim, and when in Drama we start at one of these positions.

We usually get onto the Drama Triangle when we age not getting what we want, and our starting position may be coupled with someone else's drama behaviour or we may get on the drama triangle ourselves at our starting gate position. The coupled reaction of Barry Oshry's Seeing Systems is another useful perspective on conversations here.


Once in drama we can quickly go through the 3 states, or oscilate between two. Others are likely to be moving around the triangle too.

## Notice your own drama
 Initially it's useful to notice when you are on the drama triangle in different relationships in your life.

### Exercises
#### What you say as Persecutor

#### What you say as Rescuer

#### What you say as Victim

## Notice invites onto drama

### When invited to join a Persecutor
* But they are idiots, right?
* Why did they do that? (without curiosity)

### When invited to Rescue a Victim
* Oops, I always get this wrong.
* I can't do this.

### When invited to Victim
* We'll there is nothing you can do, is there?
* I'd just give up.
* It's pointless for you to do that.

### What to Say when declining an invite to drama
In declining an invite to drama there are at least two things occurring.
* You decline to see the situation from any of the positions on the drama triangle.
* You react to the response of the person behind the invite
 * They may be on the triangle themselves
 * or they may be knowingly getting you to react in a particular way



# Coaching yourself off drama

# Coaching someone else off drama

# The tools we need
### 1. Knowledge of the Drama Triange and our own starting gate positions

### Things to think about
* What are our patterns?
 * What patterns do others notice?
* How do we get onto drama?
* Are some people or situations better than others at getting us into drama?

## 2. Clean Feedback.
### Evidence, Inference, Impact

For each position on the drama triangle that we occupy  in a situation we can ask for Clean Feedback. The format for Clean Feedback is
* Evidence
  * What happened exactly

* Inference
  * What conclusions are we making

* Impact
  * What effect does this have

In Clean Feedback we ask the previous three questions for the following
* What went well (www)
  * Evidence, Inference, Impact
* What went no so well (wwnsw)
  * Evidence, Inference, Impact
* What could work better next time (wcwbnt)
  * Evidence, Inference, Impact

### practice Clean Feedback
Give clean feedback to others. Initially this can be for non-drama.


### 3. Clean Setup
We can use the Clean Setup questions
When *drama situation* goes as you'd like, it would be like what?
When *drama situation* goes as you'd like, you would be like what?
What support or resources do you need?

## Alternative inquiry position for the Drama Triangle
Using the Clean Feedback questions we can find out more about ourselves in each position on the drama triangle. We can re-imagine the drama positions as

**Persecutor to Authenticator**
* What *exactly* did we see and hear?
* What feedback can we give?
* What am I assuming about the situation?
* What would I like to have happen
* Use Clean Setup, and Development Task.

**Rescuer to Mediator**
* What happens before?
* What have we *actually been asked* to do?
* How do I know I have to?
* Then Clean Setup and Development Task.

**Victim to Negotiator**
* What do I want to have happen?
* What do I need to do before I get that?
* Then Clean Setup and Development Task.
