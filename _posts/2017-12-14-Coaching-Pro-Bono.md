title: So, I'm a coach.
---
Some of you may know I'm currently training to be a coach. Put simply this enables me to help you get more of the things you want. That can be getting in zone more often, coping better in situations, working out things that don't feel right.

Clean Language coaching is great for people who like me, sometimes need some help solving their own problems. I won't tell you what to do, but I'll help you work out what needs to happen. The questions I ask *are the coaching* so I can help with most thing I can ask a question about*.

The people I've coached already say I've got a friendly relaxed style that brings out 'lightbulb moments'. I'm curious and non judgmental, which is partly what the 'Clean' bit means.

I've solved my own problems all my life. But Clean Coaching has helped me understand what's going on in a way that I couldn't otherwise see.

I'm getting started coaching, and I have a job to pay the rent. So if you'd like to get more of what you want drop me a line and for a limited time it won't cost you nothing. (I mean it *will* cost you nothing.)


The specific training I'm doing is
* [ILM 5 Coaching and Mentoring with Clean Language](https://cleanlearning.co.uk/does/detail/ilm-level-5-certificate-coaching-mentoring), with [Marion Way](https://cleanlearning.co.uk/are/marian-way)
* [Systemic Modelling](https://cleanlearning.co.uk/resources/faq/what-is-systemic-modelling) with [Caitlin Walker](https://cleanlearning.co.uk/are/caitlin-walker)

*I'm not a therapist. But I know some good ones if you need them.
