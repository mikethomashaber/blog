#### Clean Setup
"*The process is an example of the solution*"


..missed a bit...

I won't do "at my worst" if group is not safe. More likely to provoke a strong reaction.

Will do something to provoke responses. Systemic Modelling training specific to attendees needs for the types of situations.

Patterns occur after 3 times. We have a strong "don't go to assumption". We know from clean setup what people want, but we don't know why. After three times it's legitimate to raise with the group. "I'll tell you what I'm noticing." When X does X Shaun does Y.

If group only mentions loo, break etc, then the group will only tell about physical needs. Also get 'Why are we wasting time talking about what she wants' Ok, so for this person what is important is that we start. "but we have started." "But we have started" Because this IS IT. We get the group to manage. What is going on in the group that we don't know about that affects where their attention is.

Learn in pairs. A + B a gives feedback, then a gives feedback. If not A + B then like Jackie post what went wrong on Facebook.

Can this be used online - yes good for online.

If you're not confident they won't trust you. Find playground voluntary groups to play with, so make mistakes offline.


In Microsoft "I can't bear this" "If this restructuring was to go just as you'd like it" Then they built metaphor.

What happens next. Go and practice then come back with next question. On assesment I will provoke you - groups will hate you.

So do you understand it.
Then level 1 can you deliver it, and get the group to take part.
level 2 can you detect their patterns then detect a pattern to help someone else. Play it like an orchestra.

Example
Group of Managers. Whatever group Tanya is in is not doing the exercies. How do you not go to contempt about it - just that's interesting. Allegiance is to the group - So what am I going to do?

NLP Meta Programs.
Detail <-> Big Picture
Match <-> Mismatch - so Who's a mismatcher? Who's keen to do what they are asked to do and who isn't

So put Tanya in a bind. So ask the group and they say Tanya is a mismatcher - whatever I say she mismatches. So if on the next go she mismatches she proves me right, if she doesn't she proves me wrong, the group gets to do the exercise. Allegiance to the group.

May seem manipulative - but OK as long as it's not done with contempt.

So at uni. One person research. These idiots don't research.
Other person It's all about diversity.
So I need to get person A to understand B is a point of research, and B to see A as diversity.

So they need they become curious about each other.

It's (Clean for Teams) tough, but a bit matrix-y.

So groups with someone who is always right will put in group who are less sure.

The teenagers will "do you". Jacqueline says to Chris - "pick that litter up" - and she'd put herself in the position of expert above the group. They would take her out!  Needed rescueing. What do you need to do here "Chris what I'm noticing is that you dropped that. What's happening?" "Well I didn't drop it, I found it over there, I've had a look and now I don't want it"

What are you going to do? "I want him to pick it up". You can't tell him to pick it up. You're not facilitating. You can share your values - and start a conversation.

Connor Moore kicking a football at my head. They manage to get themselves thrown out of every institution ever. Is this a good time for Clean Feedback? Is depends what you are doing clean feedback for?

*If you're feeding back to say you're not OK and stop it, then it's more of a Clean Slap.*

Although there is feedback around "You can't kick the ball in here, else we can't use the room", so you can feedback about environmental rules or you can have personal rules.

We're aiming to get the group to self organise, so they may say pick up the litter, or they may say "I drop litter" but they have a discussion. We don't say that my rules win. So with bind, we can't let the girl continue.

So there may need to be a teacher who can enforce external rules, like no mobile phones.
In clean need to train external people not to intervene, so that the group can learn to model.
So groups need to learn to respect, not because they are made to because they are too powerful.

SO let me handle this "What is happpening right now" "She's shouting at us" "What happened just before she was shouting at you?"  What would you like to have happen, what would she like to have happen. But you have to be sure she won't be undermined, as you will leave the school, and she will be left there.

### Do Clean setup
If these two days were just as you'd like them to be they would be like what?
(If we were a naieve group wouldn't ask clean questions)
You'd like to be like what?
What support and resources do you need?

Ask in a pair and then swap pairs for each question.

# Thursday-02.mp3
Why do we do Clean Setup?

Where is this groups attention and where is this groups attention. So if you were to ask what are the apppplications, what is the resaerch hw many organisations have you worked in. First question "What brings joy?". They wanted to know wether they trusted me.

What do these exercises do? They helps build trust? How? Because they follow the same questions I would ask myself. So you hear people as humans. It makes you think and take responsibility for yourself.

You can change the language. You can ask "If this meeting was to be really useful what would we cover", "What you would bring into it, what you would take away from it" It's a simple way to change it, but it's about *what is the responsibility here?*. Knowing what the others know is really interesting. You see where other people attention is. It's a safe space to get your immediate needs met. What makes it safe? You're being asked explicitly what you need, there are no assumptions you've been there before, and know where thing are. Also about responsability - a shift in the mind.

So, do the 5 senses, DON'T USE A TABLE between people!

 When you're going to manage a group, coach a group or have a clean interview, any of those things, it's important to remember that what the person talking to you is doing when you speak to them is unlikely to be what you would do if they were speaking to you.

 What happens in their psyche space, in their perception is unlikely to be what happens in yours. It's very easy when you are thinking and talking to forget that. So this exercise is about honing your perception about how different people think. My purpose is for you to get really really curious - *oh my goodness is that how that works? Is that what goes on in that head and mind* So get interested in each other. At the end of the exercise I'd like you to go "I've got a relatively good model of how Tanya/Kate does thinking", so you could almost predict that if i was to throw something else in there they would probably do it a bit like this.

 So that's what you're going to be asking questions for. Remember in a live business or school group we wouldn't have even touched clean questions yet. The only experience you would have had is me asking them. It would have gone much faster, because we won't have talked about it. So I'm going to give you a stimulus, you're going to think about it, and we're going to ask questions.

#### "See a Bridge, what kind of bridge is it?
T: It's rounded made from bricks. C: Is there anything else about that rounded bridge? T: Yeah, it's like a rainbow. It connects one side to the other. C: And what kind of side that side, and what kind of side is that side that this rainbow connects? There is a green side and a blue side. C: So there is a green side and a blue side. C: (to group) whos bridge is different?

Kate: My bridge is a real bridge, about 400yds from where I like, 6 arch 18 century bridge over a broad river, made of stone, it has a busy road going across it. C: 6 arch 18th century across a broad river. SO 6  arches, what kind of arches are those 6 arches? K: They're shaped in a, they're not round, come up to a point like that. C: They come up to a point arches. What sort of stone is that stone is that 18th Century Bridge? K: It's Yorkshire stone C: Is there anything else about that Yorkshire Stone for people who haven;t seen Yorkshire stone before? K: It's a light coloured stone and it has a slightly yellowish tinge.

C: One more, who is different again?
G: I have a stone bridge that goes over a steam. C: You've got a stone bridge that goes over a stream. What sort of stream? G: It's just a stream the cuts through all the fields and it flows gently most of the time. So it's a flowing stream over fields. Anything else about that stone bridge? G: It just takes one car, it's not that wide, but I see if from the river as opposed from the side of the bridge and I see it the way the bricks all come together, at the top there they're long C: And you're seeing it from the river, from this flowing stream the flows through the fields.

C: So what are some differences you're noticing in your bridges.
K: What they are made of . Shapes Purpose, if they exist in real life, S: I didn;t know if yours did exist in real life T: no. So attributes and characteristics, real and not real. Someone was talking only about the bridge, others described the outside like a river. So Context.

M: I had two bridges. I'm not showing off, but the first bridge was near where I live, across a disused railway line, but the railway line had been filled in, so it wasn't really bridgey enough. It didn't go over anything, just the bridge was there. So I've thought of another bridge. C: and this one wasn't bridgey enough? The bridge was there, but there was `    nothing it was going over  M: It's a humpback bridge, but it's not a nice humpback bridge, it's an old1960's railway bridge. It's a little bit to narrow, railing on one side C: So this wasn't bridgey enough, this one is just . M: yeah there is a really steep hill and it goes over the humpback bridge and we live hear, so in summer you hear people going down in the car, with windows down, and it's like on a fairground ride. All the kids in the back of the car screaming 'faster dad'. Which we hear from our patio.
C: And then S's S: So mine is the New Mersey . . the new bridge there is a new bridge, and when you said see a bridge, I didn't see a bridge, but what I noticed about having this new bridge in my life is the differnece it made. I was thinking back it's rare we get a new big bridge. But years ago when they first built bridges, the difference it made to communities. Amazining the time it saves the flow. It's not a beautiful bridge. Youkshire Stone sounds great, but it's functionality is. It makes life easy. When you've got this bridge, whereabouts is the bridge? It is where it is, but I can also see it. It goes like that. A guy drove over it the wrong way, he was about 90, but I was just too far ahead of him. How do you help him? C: So it goes like that - Or like this.

C: So what am I doing? You're directing his attention Asking questions. You were smiling, repeating words back, DC: What am I doing to direct attention? You were doing the movements, what S was doing. Saying words that popped out a bit higher. You know how T's words work. They pop out. They don't pop out for me. She must have the words and some of them pop out. She thinks I'm going for the popping out ones. That's what she will so. I'm certainly asking about specific words.
You gave space to talk. Generally I'm not interrupting. I do sometimes.
C: What questions have I asked. Attributes - give me more. Whereabouts. Is there anything else? Which could ask for anything.

So any patterns yet?   In yourself and others.
M & S the effefct of the bridge rather then the brifge itself. Needed to be asked to talk. Definition of bridges, bridginess, what wasn't good enough, and functionality. S The functionality, related to my setup - but I can't remember anyones setup in enough detail to see if there is any corelation between you guys  setup and how you describe the bridge. In my clean setup it was like reboot for functionality and usually I'd describe a stone bridge. But today my functionality matched my reboot for functionality setup.  I can't remember enough about your setups - too much information.
C: If I was repppeating my own systems I coudn't pay attention to other systems at the same time I'd have to do one or the other.
M: I struggle with see an elephant. I've never seen an elephant, never been to a zoo, so my elephnant  is not a real elephant it's on a tv screen, but when you say see a bridge, I've seen loads of bridges, I can do that. I thought I might always go abstract, but I didn't. So I was quite surprised C: and that's simpilar with groups. Sometimes that grouppps response is because of the kind of question you asked them, rather than that's....

C: lets do a bit more and we'll try and notice any patterns. Choose a different sense. Feel ice. What kind of ice.
G: Ice cube. Is there anything else? It's smooth, cold and wet. Whereabouts is the ice cube. In my hand. What colour is it? Opaque white. Who's not got G's icecube, Who's got a different one?  I went to a bar ages ago, and there was a big block of ice on the bar. Quite popular in other countries. I'd quite like one. And then I was noticing the mirror was dirty, and ice is clean. Who's got a question for S? Whereabout is ? It's on the bar, in this bar I went to. What do you do with it? You look at it, they have some lights on it, it looks quite nice. They shave it to make some cocktails, it was like a working artform the clarity of it was quite beautiful. Is there anything else about the colour? It was ice blue, when you see David Attenborough things, and ice has that blueness.  

*SOME MORE TO TRANSCRIBE HERE*


Thursday-03.mp3
I'm a bit confused about what systemic modeling, and I'm confused what you're aiming for in bringing stuff out.
So, Clean Language is just a set of questions you can use for 1000 things. Symbolic Modeling is where you use it to model the symbols in an individuals system.
Systemic Modeling means  you train a system to self organize. Systemic modelling is where a system is self modeling. So it's like
* We're a bit like this - so lets do that then
* Oh you want that, I don't do it, but Tanya does, go and ask her
* Do you know this is the third time this has gone wrong, let's find out what's happening, so the system self models.
And what I am doing is training a series of principals, from an experiencial level rather than a theoretical level.
* What's presented is not the same as what is inferred
  ** So I can present one instruction and the inference is different
(diagram in notes - the first one)
(Drawn not the way I draw it )
* It's the difference between what actually happened and what you are making up has happened.
* Detect your own patterns
* Detect others patterns
* Training your sensory acuity in order to build useful models
* If this was "How do like email in our team" if you say "I'd like them short" that doesn't mean everyone is going to infer the same thing.

Short for you is not short for everyone. It's not your elephant. So that's why you say "So when it's short what would I see and hear?"
So you know that (you) like lots of detail and to now what's going on, so you know that is your pattern, but if I know M. doesn't and he gets overwhelmed I don't send him long detailed emails and expect him to sift through them for the details. I *know* so I've used my sensory acuity to pick up this information, I've detected patterns in him and now my model for an email to him will be different to the model of an email to G. because I will adjust myself just enough or I will say to them "do you know what it's too hard to work out the models I just want to send my emails the way I send them, so now what are we going to do we have to negotiate" (woof)
So, with emails look at what they've just sent you, if they've put two paragraphs I'll put two paragraphs, I theirs is a page I'll make it a page. It's more likely to get a quick bit off rapport. If someone (who writes a lot) saw two lines they'd say "You've not really read that email"
So all of the skills training in the five senses is required to ask "How do you get just enough juice? going in the group, so they don't do the opposite of this and think their truth is the truth - so they don't mistake their patterns with your patterns"
"Oh you're late, so you must have no regard for this group" - but actually that would be true for me, but I wonder what it means for K. and they don't mix up - they don't just build models based on (diagram) this squashed up, because this squashed up is just a narrative of the wy things are drama/horror you have to keep paying attention, and keep going round these circuits in order to get a user model for this team or this person or this customer.
So it's a contineous thing, with these arrows - you're always separating them you're keeping them apart.
*It's very hard for us to percieve that other people have patterns that we absolutely don't have.*
So if we don't keep going round the model becomes less useful, becomes stagnant, obsolete, based on misinformation.

*Has anyone else got any questions, just for where we are right now?*

So , what I am about to do is to layer metaphors, so the reason we use metaphors, and we don't have to we can easily do this without a metaphor in sight(!), unlike symbolic modeling which is absolutely about symbols, the reason we use them is they are much more efficient carriers of information to the individual and they are memorable. So I can remember peoples metaphors for years and years afterwards, when I can't remember who they are or their names, but I know their metaphors. They have a wholeness to them, so "I know how that works", whereas with just a description you have to put it together yourself.

In Clean for Teams we'll do three metaphors
* Learning at your Best
* At your worst
* time
Three metaphors in a team give you predictability, so if someone said can you do an awayday, and I said I don't do those, but I can do you three sets of 2 hours. I don't have a lot of time so I'll just do 3 metaphors, if they want a transformational change program I'll do six, and that's because when you do six metaphors, when you know five of your own metaphors you go 'oh that's me all over' it's a real deep understanding of yourself and you tend to shift.

So if they want the group to work better I do three, if I want them to transform do six.
Because you need personal trasformation to get full on group transformation.
All of this stuff I just learnt by accident. I used to just do three, then a grouup I worded with longer I did more, and went "oh". Five years later I thought "That's interesting, all of these groups transformed I wonder what the difference was. Oh it's because they had three metaphors, and they had six." I didn't come at this theoretically, I was just asking clean language in groups, over and over and all of this started to come out, to emerge from it.

And you can make them relavent to the group, so I'm doing some basic ones with you bbecause I don't know you, but for example when we went to M. they wanted to develop collective trust.
