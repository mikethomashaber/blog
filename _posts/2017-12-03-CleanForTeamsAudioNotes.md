#### Clean Setup
"*The process is an example of the solution*"


..missed a bit...

I won't do "at my worst" if group is not safe. More likely to provoke a strong reaction.

Will do something to provoke responses. Systemic Modelling training specific to attendees needs for the types of situations.

Patterns occur after 3 times. We have a strong "don't go to assumption". We know from clean setup what people want, but we don't know why. After three times it's legitimate to raise with the group. "I'll tell you what I'm noticing." When X does X Shaun does Y.

If group only mentions loo, break etc, then the group will only tell about physical needs. Also get 'Why are we wasting time talking about what she wants' Ok, so for this person what is important is that we start. "but we have started." "But we have started" Because this IS IT. We get the group to manage. What is going on in the group that we don't know about that affects where their attention is.

Learn in pairs. A + B a gives feedback, then a gives feedback. If not A + B then like Jackie post what went wrong on Facebook.

Can this be used online - yes good for online.

If you're not confident they won't trust you. Find playground voluntary groups to play with, so make mistakes offline.


In Microsoft "I can't bear this" "If this restructuring was to go just as you'd like it" Then they built metaphor.

What happens next. Go and practice then come back with next question. On assesment I will provoke you - groups will hate you.

So do you understand it.
Then level 1 can you deliver it, and get the group to take part.
level 2 can you detect their patterns then detect a pattern to help someone else. Play it like an orchestra.

Example
Group of Managers. Whatever group Tanya is in is not doing the exercies. How do you not go to contempt about it - just that's interesting. Allegiance is to the group - So what am I going to do?

NLP Meta Programs.
Detail <-> Big Picture
Match <-> Mismatch - so Who's a mismatcher? Who's keen to do what they are asked to do and who isn't

So put Tanya in a bind. So ask the group and they say Tanya is a mismatcher - whatever I say she mismatches. So if on the next go she mismatches she proves me right, if she doesn't she proves me wrong, the group gets to do the exercise. Allegiance to the group.

May seem manipulative - but OK as long as it's not done with contempt.

So at uni. One person research. These idiots don't research.
Other person It's all about diversity.
So I need to get person A to understand B is a point of research, and B to see A as diversity.

So they need they become curious about each other.

It's (Clean for Teams) tough, but a bit matrix-y.

So groups with someone who is always right will put in group who are less sure.

The teenagers will "do you". Jacqueline says to Chris - "pick that litter up" - and she'd put herself in the position of expert above the group. They would take her out!  Needed rescueing. What do you need to do here "Chris what I'm noticing is that you dropped that. What's happening?" "Well I didn't drop it, I found it over there, I've had a look and now I don't want it"

What are you going to do? "I want him to pick it up". You can't tell him to pick it up. You're not facilitating. You can share your values - and start a conversation.

Connor Moore kicking a football at my head. They manage to get themselves thrown out of every institution ever. Is this a good time for Clean Feedback? Is depends what you are doing clean feedback for?

*If you're feeding back to say you're not OK and stop it, then it's more of a Clean Slap.*

Although there is feedback around "You can't kick the ball in here, else we can't use the room", so you can feedback about environmental rules or you can have personal rules.

We're aiming to get the group to self organise, so they may say pick up the litter, or they may say "I drop litter" but they have a discussion. We don't say that my rules win. So with bind, we can't let the girl continue.

So there may need to be a teacher who can enforce external rules, like no mobile phones.
In clean need to train external people not to intervene, so that the group can learn to model.
So groups need to learn to respect, not because they are made to because they are too powerful.

SO let me handle this "What is happpening right now" "She's shouting at us" "What happened just before she was shouting at you?"  What would you like to have happen, what would she like to have happen. But you have to be sure she won't be undermined, as you will leave the school, and she will be left there.

### Do Clean setup
If these two days were just as you'd like them to be they would be like what?
(If we were a naieve group wouldn't ask clean questions)
You'd like to be like what?
What support and resources do you need?

Ask in a pair and then swap pairs for each question.

# Thursday-02.mp3
Why do we do Clean Setup?

Where is this groups attention and where is this groups attention. So if you were to ask what are the apppplications, what is the resaerch hw many organisations have you worked in. First question "What brings joy?". They wanted to know wether they trusted me.

What do these exercises do? They helps build trust? How? Because they follow the same questions I would ask myself. So you hear people as humans. It makes you think and take responsibility for yourself.

You can change the language. You can ask "If this meeting was to be really useful what would we cover", "What you would bring into it, what you would take away from it" It's a simple way to change it, but it's about *what is the responsibility here?*. Knowing what the others know is really interesting. You see where other people attention is. It's a safe space to get your immediate needs met. What makes it safe? You're being asked explicitly what you need, there are no assumptions you've been there before, and know where thing are. Also about responsability - a shift in the mind.

So, do the 5 senses, DON'T USE A TABLE between people!

 When you're going to manage a group, coach a group or have a clean interview, any of those things, it's important to remember that what the person talking to you is doing when you speak to them is unlikely to be what you would do if they were speaking to you.

 What happens in their psyche space, in their perception is unlikely to be what happens in yours. It's very easy when you are thinking and talking to forget that. So this exercise is about honing your perception about how different people think. My purpose is for you to get really really curious - *oh my goodness is that how that works? Is that what goes on in that head and mind* So get interested in each other. At the end of the exercise I'd like you to go "I've got a relatively good model of how Tanya/Kate does thinking", so you could almost predict that if i was to throw something else in there they would probably do it a bit like this.

 So that's what you're going to be asking questions for. Remember in a live business or school group we wouldn't have even touched clean questions yet. The only experience you would have had is me asking them. It would have gone much faster, because we won't have talked about it. So I'm going to give you a stimulus, you're going to think about it, and we're going to ask questions.

#### "See a Bridge, what kind of bridge is it?
T: It's rounded made from bricks. C: Is there anything else about that rounded bridge? T: Yeah, it's like a rainbow. It connects one side to the other. C: And what kind of side that side, and what kind of side is that side that this rainbow connects? There is a green side and a blue side. C: So there is a green side and a blue side. C: (to group) whos bridge is different?

Kate: My bridge is a real bridge, about 400yds from where I like, 6 arch 18 century bridge over a broad river, made of stone, it has a busy road going across it. C: 6 arch 18th century across a broad river. SO 6  arches, what kind of arches are those 6 arches? K: They're shaped in a, they're not round, come up to a point like that. C: They come up to a point arches. What sort of stone is that stone is that 18th Century Bridge? K: It's Yorkshire stone C: Is there anything else about that Yorkshire Stone for people who haven;t seen Yorkshire stone before? K: It's a light coloured stone and it has a slightly yellowish tinge.

C: One more, who is different again?
G: I have a stone bridge that goes over a steam. C: You've got a stone bridge that goes over a stream. What sort of stream? G: It's just a stream the cuts through all the fields and it flows gently most of the time. So it's a flowing stream over fields. Anything else about that stone bridge? G: It just takes one car, it's not that wide, but I see if from the river as opposed from the side of the bridge and I see it the way the bricks all come together, at the top there they're long C: And you're seeing it from the river, from this flowing stream the flows through the fields.

C: So what are some differences you're noticing in your bridges.
K: What they are made of . Shapes Purpose, if they exist in real life, S: I didn;t know if yours did exist in real life T: no. So attributes and characteristics, real and not real. Someone was talking only about the bridge, others described the outside like a river. So Context.

M: I had two bridges. I'm not showing off, but the first bridge was near where I live, across a disused railway line, but the railway line had been filled in, so it wasn't really bridgey enough. It didn't go over anything, just the bridge was there. So I've thought of another bridge. C: and this one wasn't bridgey enough? The bridge was there, but there was `    nothing it was going over  M: It's a humpback bridge, but it's not a nice humpback bridge, it's an old1960's railway bridge. It's a little bit to narrow, railing on one side C: So this wasn't bridgey enough, this one is just . M: yeah there is a really steep hill and it goes over the humpback bridge and we live hear, so in summer you hear people going down in the car, with windows down, and it's like on a fairground ride. All the kids in the back of the car screaming 'faster dad'
